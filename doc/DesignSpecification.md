Ax/Wx - Traffic Accident / Weather Analysis - Design Specification
==================================================================


COMPONENTS
----------
_This section lists the components that we expect to have in our project (not necessarily a complete list), what they do, and how they interface (e.g., functions with inputs and outputs). This includes documentation for existing packages. For the components we have or plan to implement, we have listed the inputs and outputs._

#### Getting the latitude and longitude from the weather stations

Use the data scraped previously from Weather Underground (WU) listing the unique station identification. From these data, we created a script to obtain the latitude and longitude from these weather stations. The script runs as follows:

- Load the data into python using a `pandas' DataFrame.
- We used the urllib3 package to make each URL request.
- The beautiful soup package was used to parse the XML document that was returned from each URL call.
- Any missing data was filled in with NA's.

#### WU Personal Weather Station Observation Data Retrieval

For this component, we use two functions: `scrape_data_one_day` retrieves data from a single weather station for a single day and outputs the data as a `pandas` DataFrame. The function uses the `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` packages. A second function - `scrape_data_multi_day` - acts as a wrapper around the `scrape_data_one_day` function, returning a `pandas` DataFrame with observation data from a single station over a range of dates. We will run the `scrape_data_multi_day` function over the list of personal weather stations generated by the PWS list component described above.

#### WU Personal Weather Station Observation Cleanup

For this component, we will use a function that takes a `pandas` DataFrame from the WU PWS Observation Data Retrieval a single station and cleans it according to various issues identified in the data. The script will also include an aggregation component to reduce the size of the project's weather database.

#### Collision Data - Washington State Patrol (WSP) Collision Analysis Tool (CAT)
https://fortress.wa.gov/wsp/collisionanalysistool

The CAT provides the means to pull collision data that will be utilized in the project. This data can be pulled any time, with any filters (e.g., data ranges, cities, or counties) and can then be passed through the collision data cleanup. The data is provided by the WSP which keeps a detailed database of all reported collisions in Washington State. 

#### Collision Data Cleanup

The raw data includes several attributes that are not pertinent to the project and Ax/Wx visualization tool (217 attributes total). The purpose of the collision data cleanup is to get the data in such a format that it can be merged with the WU data and overlaid onto a map. To merge the two datasets, a function has been designed to transform the current WSP coordinate system (input) to global latitudes and longitudes (output). These new coordinates will be used to merge the collision data with the weather data.

#### Merge of Collision Data and Weather Data

Using the coordinate mapping for the collision data, the plan is to design a function that takes the latitudes and longitudes as input and finds the nearest weather station information from the weather data. The weather data will be appended to the collision data, providing a new data file that is ready for the visualization process.

#### Visualization of Data

The visualization will consist of a GUI with several plots of the collision/weather data.  There will be descriptive text aids for how to use the tool's interactive features at the top.  Once familiar with the tool, the user can look directly below at applying filters for precipitation rate, temperature, and date-time and then draw inferences based on their business need.

These interactions can help the user hone in on areas of interest and will update the plots in the GUI.  These will be plots of the following:

- A primary visualization of a city map of Seattle with collisions marked by color based off collision type (fatality, distraction, impairment, weather induced or pedestrian involvement).
- A smaller supplementary time-series plot of collision frequency (per hour).
- A smaller supplementary bar graph of the number of collisions (per hour) by collision type.

The Python packages that will be utilized for the visualization are listed as follows:

- `bokeh` - http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/dev_guide/documentation.html
	- The package `bokeh` is an interactive visualization library to help aid presentation by use of advanced custom graphics (such as interactive plots, dashboards, and data applications) in the style of D3.js.
- `folium` - https://folium.readthedocs.io/en/latest
	- The package `folium` is a library with built-in tile sets from `OpenStreetMap`, `Mapbox`, and `Stamen`, supporting `GeoJSON` and `TopoJSON` overlays. Overall, it has a strength in map overlays.


INTERACTIONS
------------

Most of the components listed above are preliminary steps required to get the data in such a format that it can easily be viewed by users. The culmination of the data retrieval and cleaning process will be a single database of collision data with associated weather data; this database will be used in our visualization tool.

The visualization tool itself will simply display collision and weather data based on user selections. It will default to show data for all collisions in the region. Various scroll bars and buttons will be provided for filtering the data. Clicking these buttons will filter the data based on the users' selections. For example, clicking the "Monday" button will trigger a filter of the collision and weather database to just those collisions that occurred on Mondays. Similarly, selecting a subset of the map will result in the map zooming in on the region of interest, and the database will be filtered based on this selection as well.

Specific user-based interactions are briefly described below.

#### Traffic Engineer

Recently in Seattle, traffic engineers have implemented “variable speed zones” on I-5 based on traffic patterns. A traffic engineer could use the predictive analysis of Ax/Wx to determine where more “variable speed zones” should be implemented, and when the speed should be adjusted (i.e. collisions occur X% more often at location Y when the weather conditions are Z).

#### Law Enforcement Officer

A law enforcement officer could look at the weather report prior to planning his or her shift, and subsequently use the Ax/Wx tool to determine where collisions are more likely to occur given the current weather (predictive analysis based on past conditions). Providing an increased law enforcement presence in those specific locations may reduce collisions.

#### Insurance Company

With Ax/Wx, an individual working for an insurance company could determine whether an insured driver drives frequently in areas known to have an increased risk of collisions due to inclement weather conditions. Alternatively, they could also use Ax/Wx to reduce premiums for drivers that drive more often in fair weather or along roadways that are not significantly impacted by weather conditions.

#### Common Driver

Ax/Wx could provide drivers with the best route possible for avoiding traffic collisions (based on historical data), given the current weather conditions.
