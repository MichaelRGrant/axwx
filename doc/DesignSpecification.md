Ax/Wx - Traffic Accident / Weather Analysis - Design Specification
==================================================================


COMPONENTS
----------
_This section should list the components that you expect to have in your project (not necessarily a complete list), what they do, and how their interfaces (e.g., functions with inputs and outputs). If the component is an existing package, then you should point to a documentation for the package. If the component is something that you'll build, then describe (maybe at a high level) the functions and their inputs and outputs._

<stuff here>


INTERACTIONS
------------
_You should have a subsection here for each use case in your functional specification (homework 6). In each subsection, you will describe how the components interact to accomplish the use case._
